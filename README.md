# Implementing a Wordpress Website with LVM Storage Management
## Understanding Three-Tier Architecture
A **Three-Tier Architecture** is a client-server architecture model that separates an application into three interconnected but distinct layers, each responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality. 

Generally, web or mobile solutions are implemented based on **Three-Tier Architecture** to improve scalability and flexibility. The three distinct layers are:

**1. Presentation Layer (PL)**: This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.

**2. Business Layer (BL)**: This is the backend program that implements business logic (_i.e. Application or Web Server_).

**3. Data Access or Management Layer (DAL)**: This is the layer for computer data storage and data access (_i.e. Database Server or File System Server such as FTP Server or NFS Server_).
